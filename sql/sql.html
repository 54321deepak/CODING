passward =sqlsql
database ke andar tables rahati hai.
datatypes:-
1=int =interger= 1,-1,0
2=float= -0.8 ,0.0 ,9.0
3=boolean=true,false
4=char=fixed length string  contain numbers,letters,special character
5=varchar= variable length string  contain numbers,letters,special character
6=date= yyyy-mm-dd
7=datetime= date time combination , format is yyyy-mm-dd

primary /foreign keys
primary keys =unique column in table to easy identify data.
one table has one primary key column , unique and not null

foriegn keys=foriegn key column link two or more tables
table can have any number of foriegn keys,can contain dublicate value & null value 

constranints =condition
constraints are condition that has to be fill fulled
syntax:-
CREATE TABLE table-name(
    column_name1 datatype constraints,
    column_name2 datatype constraints,
)
constraints
1=NOT NULL = column can not have null value
2=UNIQUE=all values in column are different
3-primary key=combination of NOT NULL & UNIQUE
4=foreign key =prevent action that  destroy links between 2 tables
5=CHECK=you add condition ,column satisfy specific condition on values ex=values position ex values greater than 5
6=DEFAULT=if no value in column ,this default value is added
7=CREATE INDEX= used to create or retrieve data from database very fast
