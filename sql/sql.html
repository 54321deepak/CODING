sql me row ko record bolte hai
database ke andar tables rahati hai.

datatypes:-
1=int =interger= 1,-1,0
2=float= -0.8 ,0.0 ,9.0
3=boolean=true,false
4=char=fixed length string means char(10) me bas 'deepak' 6values dali to extra 4 automatic fill ho jaegi empty , contain numbers,letters,special character eg = 'a'  'deepak' '5555' '-55555' 'deepak vishal soniya'
5=varchar= variable length string means varchar(10) me bas 'deepak' 6 values dali to extra 4 automatic fill nahi hogi ,4 palce include hi nahi hogi  contain numbers,letters,special character eg = 'a'  'deepak' '5555' '-55555' 'deepak vishal soniya'
6=date= yyyy-mm-dd
7=datetime= date time combination , format is yyyy-mm-dd

varchar me (size) ye dalna jaruji warna error 
int8 and int(8) or char8 or char(8)are same but use normally like int(4)
float me size size set nahi karte
agar  ye (size) nahi do to by default wala leleta hai = int ka 11,char 1,
char me nahi dege to by default 1 lega or ye sahi nahi hai

char me size 50 tak or varchar me unlimited,float me 24 us ke baad double use kar te hai,int me 10 values 

primary /foreign keys
primary keys =unique column in table to easy identify data.
one table has one primary key column , unique and not null

foriegn keys=foriegn key column link two or more tables
table can have any number of foriegn keys,can contain dublicate value & null value 

/////constranints =condition
constraints are condition that has to be fill fulled
syntax:-
create table-name(
    column_name1 datatype constraints,
    column_name2 datatype constraints,
)
constraints
1=NOT NULL = column can not have empty place.
2=UNIQUE=all values in column are different
3-primary key=combination of NOT NULL & UNIQUE.
4=foreign key =prevent action that  destroy links between 2 tables
5=CHECK=you add condition ,column satisfy specific condition on values ex=values position ex values greater than 5
6=DEFAULT=if no value in column ,this default value is added
7=CREATE INDEX= used to create or retrieve data from database very fast    

//yaha se sab right hoga

syntax

create database testdb;

//joins
joins means combine tables.
joins clause is used to combine 2 or more tables based upon related column between them.

1.INNER JOIN
2 LEFT OUTER JOIN or LEFT JOIN
3 RIGHT OUTER JOIN or RIGHT JOIN
4 FULL OUTER JOIN or FULL JOIN or OUTER JOIN

CREATE TABLE payment
(
id int PRIMARY KEY,
address varchar(50) NOT NULL,
number int NOT NULL
);  

INSERT INTO payment
 (id , address , number )
VALUES
(1, '15 guru' , 1111),
(2,'16 guru',2222),
(10,'17 guru',3333),
(11,'18 guru',4444)
;

note:- ON tables ka sequence metter nahi karta
note:- FROM wali table left me aaegi or join wali right me
note:- jab SELECT ke bad column ke name likhege dono table ke ushi sequence me output aaega.

1. INNER JOIN = return records that have matching values in both table.

syntax= SELECT column(s)
        FROM  tableA
        INNER JOIN tableB
        ON tableA.column_name = tableB.column_name;
        
        syntax= SELECT column(s)
        FROM  tableA
        INNER JOIN tableB
        ON tableB.column_name = tableA.column_name;
 
        
        ex= SELECT *
        FROM  customer
        INNER JOIN payment
        ON customer.id = payment.id;
        
        ex= SELECT *
        FROM  customer AS c
        INNER JOIN payment AS p
        ON c.id = p.id;

        SELECT name , number
        FROM  customer AS c
        INNER JOIN payment AS p
        ON c.id = p.id;

        
        SELECT c.name, p.number
        FROM  customer AS c
        INNER JOIN payment AS p
        ON c.id = p.id;

        SELECT  p.number,c.name
        FROM  customer AS c
        INNER JOIN payment AS p
        ON c.id = p.id;

        inner ki jagah join use kiya

        SELECT  *
        FROM  customer 
        JOIN payment ON customer.id = payment.id;

2. LEFT JOIN= return all record from left table and only record from the right table that matchesthe left table 

NOTE=   lEFT join me ON me tableA.column_name = tableB.column_name;  or tableB.column_name = tableA.column_name;    same nahi hi hai .  left side wali table pe operation hoga. 

syntax:- SELECT column(s)
FROM  tableA
LEFT JOIN tableB
ON tableA.column_name = tableB.column_name;

// ye dana same hai
        ex= SELECT *
        FROM  customer AS c
        LEFT JOIN payment AS p
        ON c.id = p.id;
   
        ex= SELECT *
        FROM  customer AS c
        LEFT JOIN payment AS p
        ON p.id = c.id;


3. RIGHT JOIN= return all record from right table and only  record from the left table that matches the right table. 

syntax:- SELECT column(s)
FROM  tableA
RIGHT JOIN tableB
ON tableA.column_name = tableB.column_name;

        ex= SELECT *
        FROM  customer AS c
        RIGHT JOIN payment AS p
        ON c.id = p.id;

        EX=SELECT *
        FROM  customer AS c
        RIGHT JOIN payment AS p
        ON p.id = c.id;

4.FULL OUTER JOIN= return all record from right table and the left table
// it is noy working any more .use union

        syntax:- SELECT column(s)
        FROM  tableA
        FULL OUTER JOIN tableB
        ON tableA.column_name = tableB.column_name;
        
        EX=SELECT *
        FROM  payment AS c
        FULL OUTER JOIN customer AS p
        ON p.id = c.id;

use union

2 tables

        SELECT *
        FROM customer
        LEFT JOIN payment 
        ON customer.id = payment.id
        UNION
        SELECT *
        FROM customer
        RIGHT JOIN payment 
        ON customer.id = payment.id;

5. return all part of A - common of   A and B

SELECT *
FROM customer  A
LEFT JOIN payment B 
ON A.id = B.id
WHERE B.id IS NULL;

6.return all part of B - common of A and B

SELECT *
FROM customer  A
RIGHT JOIN payment B 
ON A.id = B.id
WHERE A.id IS NULL;

7.FULL A+B - common of A and B

SELECT *
